🛡️ Final Project – Iron Helmet
A real-time soldier protection system designed to detect incoming threats and simulate interception.

🔧 Key Features
GPS Integration – Tracks the soldier’s real-time location.

Shot Detection – Uses AMMS sensor input to identify projectile threats.

Interception Simulation – Intercepts an M16A1 projectile using a laser beam (up to 20 meters).

3D Visualization – Simulated environment built with the OpenGL library.

🧪 Technologies Used
C++ / Arduino

OpenGL (simulation)

GPS Module

AMMS Sensor

Laser Range Module

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository.

Insert your API key into the file named API_key.

Run the project through the main executable.

📝 Notes
The system simulates short-distance projectile interception (up to 20m).

“Iron Helmet” – Final Software Engineering project combining hardware (GPS, sensors), laser interception logic, and 3D simulation (OpenGL).
